Navigate to a location where you want to install LogShark and unzip the file there.


### Running LogShark from any Directory (add to PATH)
If you want to run LogShark from anywhere, you need to add the directory where you unzipped LogShark to your PATH system variable. Here are instructions on how to do it in Windows 10.

1. In Search, search for and then select: **System**.
1. Click the **Advanced system settings** link.
1. Click **Environment Variables**. In the section System Variables, find the `PATH` environment variable and select it. Click **Edit**. If the PATH environment variable does not exist, click **New**.
1. In the **Edit System Variable** (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the `PATH` environment variable. Click OK. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK.

**NOTE:** The archive logs will need to be unzipped or copied to the drive where you have installed Logshark. If your `C:\` drive is low on space, you should install Logshark in a different location. :question: **TRUE?**
