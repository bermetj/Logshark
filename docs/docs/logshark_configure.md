title: Configure and Customize Logshark
---

By default, LogShark picks up its configuration settings from the config file that is located in the `<LogShark_install_location>\Config\LogSharkConfig.json` file. Some of these configuration settings can be overridden at the command line. Other settings can only be set in the configuration file.

### Config
Example of config file

```xml
{
  "HyperServerLocation": "Hyper",
  "Logging": {
    "PathFormat": "Logs/LogShark-{Date}.log",
    "Json": false,
    "FileSizeLimitBytes": 10485760,
    "RetainedFileCountLimit": 5,
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Debug",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    },
    "Console": {
      "IncludeScopes": true
    }
  },
  "EnvironmentConfig": {
    "TempDirOverride": null,
    "OutputDir": "Output",
    "OutputDirMaxResults": null,
    "WorkbookTemplatesDir": "Workbooks",
    "CustomWorkbookTemplatesDir": null,
    "NumberOfErrorDetailsToKeep": 25,
    "AppendLogsetNameToOutput": false
  },
  "TableauServer": {
    "Url": "<EnterServerUrlHere>",
    "Site": "<EnterSiteNameHere>",
    "Username": "<EnterUsernameHere>",
    "Password": "<EnterPasswordHere>",
    "Timeout": 240,
    "GroupsToProvideWithDefaultPermissions": [ "All Users" ],
    "ParentProject": {
      "Id": "",
      "Name": ""
    }
}
```

### Saving Output in a Different Directory
By default LogShark saves resulting workbooks in the same directory where is it ran an Output folder. If you want to specify a different directory, add a full path to the `OutputDir` variable in the config file.

NOTE: You need to escape back slashes by using double slashes.

```xml
"OutputDir": "C:\\Users\\Full Path\\All the answers you need",
```

----
### Including your own Custom Workbooks
One of the neat features LogShark 4.0 provides, is the ability to easily include your own custom workbooks in a LogShark run. You can specify a folder where your custom workbooks are located in `CustomWorkbookTemplatesDir` variable in the config file. **Make sure that the extract file name(s) in your customized workbooks match the name(s) of the extract file(s) generated by LogShark run.** During next run LogShark will include your workbooks in the run. Please note that if you modify workbooks in LogShark\'s `<LogShark_install_location>/Workbooks` folder, all your subsequent runs will be affected.

NOTE: You need to escape back slashes by using double slashes.

```xml
"CustomWorkbookTemplatesDir": "C:\\Users\\Full Path\\My Awesome Workbooks",
```

----
### Attach Logset's Name to the Workbook
If you are working on several cases at the same time, having several Apache workbooks open at the same time can get confusing quickly. With this version you can differentiate between workbooks by attaching the name of the logset to the workbook name by setting `AppendLogsetNameToOutput` to **true**. The resulting workbooks will be named **<PluginName>_<LogsetName>.twbx**, e.g. **Apache_TinyLog.twbx**.


```xml
"AppendLogsetNameToOutput": true
```

You can also override the config value in command line using  `--workbookname "<string>"`command.

### Publishing into Sub-projects on Tableau Server

If you want to publish logs into sub-projects on Tableau Server, you can do so easily by specifying either `ParentProject` or `ID` variable in the config file. (You only need to provide one or of the other. If you provided both, ID is used.) Make sure that the project folder already exists on the site.

`ID` variable is GUID of the project. You can get it using Tableau Rest API. You only really ever need to use ID if the name of the project you want to use is present more than once on the site.

If neither name nor id specified (default) - LogShark created projects at the root of the site

 
```xml
"ParentProject": {
  "Id": "",
  "Name": ""
}
```

### Changing format of LogShark's logs to JSON
LogShark generates saves run summaries as logs in the LogSharkâ€™s `<LogShark_install_location>\Logs` folder. You can specify the format to be JSON by flipping the Json switch to true. 

 
```xml
"Json": true,
```
